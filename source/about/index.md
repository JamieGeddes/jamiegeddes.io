Hi, I'm Jamie Geddes, a professional software engineer with many years of development experience. Currently I work for [Craneware](http://www.craneware.com) as a senior software engineer, working with a mix of desktop, web and cloud technologies.  I have a varied background including everything from writing code for embedded devices to writing modern web applications and services hosted in the cloud. In my role as a senior software engineer, I develop for Microsoft's Azure platform, but enjoy using AWS services for personal projects. I'm an avid learner and couldn't live without my [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) subscription!
