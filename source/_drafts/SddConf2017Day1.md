I'm at the 2017 SDD Conference in London this week. I've been to a couple of the DevWeek conferences in the past, run by the same orgnaniser but this is my first visit to SDD (Software Design & Development.

The keynote, "The art of problem solving" was an interesting and entertaining presentation by Mark Richards, discussing the many different ways of solving a given problem. As software developers, problem solving is something we almost take for granted, but Mark's talk covered the different ways in which a problem can be analyzed and steps taken towards a solution.
